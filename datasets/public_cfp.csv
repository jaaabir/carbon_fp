Trelleborg has measured a 6% reduction of the carbon footprint related to the working life of a Trelleborg BlueTire Technology compared to standard technology tires. Total emissions: 1408.62 kg CO2 (3.8 kg CO2 per unit * 370.69 kg, weight of 1329200 - 710/70R42TL TM1000HP - BlueTire)",Trelleborg AB,Sweden,Capital Goods,Electrical Equipment,Comm. equipm. & capital goods,370.69,1408.62,3.8

IFCO RPCs are made in different standard sizes covering a range of fruit and vegetable produce applications. IFCO’s RPC types are mutually compatible (i.e., in terms of stacking properties) for segregated and mixed dispatch units and suited to the use of jawed loaders as well as materials handling technology and automatic storage systems. Definition of functional unit: products are compared on the basis of providing the same defined function or unit of service which is called the functional unit. The function of produce containers is to transport fresh produce from growers to retail locations. In the case of the RPCs and DRCs, the containers can also be used to display the produce at retail stores. The functional unit of this LCA is based on an equivalent quantity of produce delivered to stores: 1,000 tonnes of produce delivered to retail stores in North America (US or Canada).",Brambles,Australia,Trading Companies & Distributors and Commercial Services & Supplies,Not used for 2015 reporting,Comm. equipm. & capital goods,2.4062,89.567,37.22

Which means you produce 60% more energy over 25 years and save more on your electricity bills, too. •More flexibility: Because E-Series residential solar panels generate more electricity from a smaller area, you can expand energy production simply by using additional roof space to add more panels later. •More peace of mind: More guaranteed power.
